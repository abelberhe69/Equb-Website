# Equb-Website
Equb is a traditional way of saving money. Some people that know eachother well will gather and form a group to save money, and the amount of the cash is constant and depending on the number of participators the length of the equb will be dicided. Each member will deposit the decided money per month until all the people in that group will get their money. Based on this traditional money saving method, our WebTech instructor gave us a project that stores the group members vital information and the scale of money they wanted to save each month. After collecting this data, the system will generate a random winner for the month and award their money.
